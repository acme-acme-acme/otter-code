# Otter Code

Otter Code is a fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) with its own name, app IDs,
relay, and release channel. Everything in `AGENTS.md` still applies. This file covers what is
different and how to keep the fork aligned with upstream.

## How the fork stays in sync

- `main` is the upstream commit recorded in the `upstream-base` branch plus exactly three commits,
  in this order:
  1. `chore(otter): brand fork as Otter Code`: names, IDs, domains, icons, relay values, this file,
     and `scripts/otter/`.
  2. `ci(otter): release Otter Code and sync upstream daily`: release gating and
     `.github/workflows/otter-sync-upstream.yml`.
  3. `chore(otter): adapt upstream files (generated)`: output of `.github/scripts/otter-adapt-upstream.sh`.
     Never edit it by hand. The sync drops and regenerates it after every rebase, so noisy
     line-level edits to upstream files (runner labels, skipped Windows jobs, the pointer in
     `AGENTS.md`) never conflict.
- The upstream ref comes from the `UPSTREAM_REF` repository variable (default: PR #2829's head).
  Set it to `refs/heads/main` once that PR merges.
- **Sync:** every day at 08:00 Europe/Berlin, `Sync upstream` rebases the fork commits onto the latest
  upstream and dispatches a nightly release when upstream moved. On a conflict it opens an issue
  titled "Upstream sync conflict" with the exact `git rebase --onto` command to resolve it locally.
- **Changing the fork:** fold edits into the matching commit, never add loose commits or merge
  upstream:

  ```sh
  git commit --fixup=<commit to amend>
  GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=: git rebase -i --autosquash origin/upstream-base
  git push --force-with-lease origin main
  ```

  If the generated commit is last and you touched files it changes, drop it
  (`git reset --hard HEAD~1`), rebase, rerun the script, and commit its output again.

- **Keep the diff small:** prefer repository variables and secrets over code, and new files
  over edits to upstream files. Leave internal names (`@t3tools/*`, `T3CODE_*`, code identifiers)
  alone. `scripts/otter/rebrand-ui-text.sh` renames client UI text; it runs only by hand, and
  its exclusions list text that must keep matching what the server or agents emit.

Secrets live in the repository's Actions secrets and its `production` environment.

## Releases

- **Desktop and server runtimes:** `release.yml` (T3's pipeline) builds macOS arm64/x64 and Linux
  x64/arm64 on GitHub-hosted runners and publishes a nightly GitHub Release that installed apps
  offer in their update dialog. Windows, AUR, marketing, and Discord are skipped.
  Start one by hand with `gh workflow run release.yml -f channel=nightly`.
- **CLI on npm:** the same run publishes `otter-code` and its `@otterware/otter-code-<platform>`
  packages with the `NPM_TOKEN` secret (an npm account that is a member of the `otterware` org),
  tagged `nightly` and also `latest`, so `npx otter-code` and `npm i -g otter-code` get the newest
  build. The token is needed because new packages have no npm trusted publisher yet.
- **Relay:** `Deploy T3 Connect relay` runs on every push to `main`. The relay adopts the
  existing `otterware.dev` zone and a PlanetScale database with a retain policy. Never run
  `alchemy destroy` against `prod`. Its PlanetScale service token (`PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN*`)
  needs `delete_production_branch_password` and `delete_branch_password` on the database.
  Alchemy runs migrations as a temporary role and deletes it with `postgres` as successor, which
  hands the new tables to `postgres`. Without those accesses the deletion fails with only a
  warning, the tables stay owned by the expired role, and a later `ALTER TABLE` migration fails
  with `must be owner of table`.
- **iOS** is built and uploaded locally, not in CI:

  ```sh
  cd apps/mobile
  pnpm dlx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios --profile production --local --non-interactive \
    --output ../../../otter-code-builds/otter-code-ios.ipa </dev/null
  xcrun altool --upload-app -f ../../../otter-code-builds/otter-code-ios.ipa -t ios \
    --apiKey <key id> --apiIssuer <issuer id>   # key from API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR
  ```

  Use a **release** Xcode; App Store Connect rejects beta toolchains (error 90534). Public build
  config (`T3CODE_CLERK_*`, `T3CODE_RELAY_URL`) is stored as EAS environment variables. Don't put
  it in a gitignored `.env.local`: EAS builds from a clean copy of the repo, and the runtime
  fingerprints would not match.

## Moving a machine from T3 Code

`scripts/otter/migrate-from-t3.sh` copies a T3 Code home (V2 preview or T3 Nightly) into
`~/.otter-code`. Threads, projects, settings, secrets, attachments, and the environment ID
come along, so saved connections to that machine keep matching. It never modifies the
source. Run it with `--dry-run` first.

- **Desktop:** quit both apps first (the script refuses while a database is open), then:

  ```sh
  scripts/otter/migrate-from-t3.sh --from ~/.t3/orchestrator-preview-2829
  open -a "Otter Code"
  ```

- **Server with a systemd unit:** install the Otter Code runtime into the new home, then let the
  script stop the old unit, copy, install `otter-code.service`, and restore the old unit if
  anything fails:

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acme-acme-acme/otter-code/main/scripts/install.sh \
    | T3CODE_HOME=~/.otter-code T3CODE_CHANNEL=nightly sh
  scripts/otter/migrate-from-t3.sh --from ~/.t3/orchestrator-preview-2829 \
    --stop-unit t3code-pr2829.service --wait-idle 10 --install-service
  ```

  The installer links the command as `otter-code`, so it never replaces an installed T3 Code's
  `t3`. The script refuses to touch T3 Nightly's `t3code.service`.

Deliberately not copied:

- Desktop client files encrypted with the old app's Keychain key (`connection-catalog.json`,
  `clerk-tokens.json`, `cloud-auth-token.json`). Otter Code can't read them, and its window
  would stay empty.
- The stored T3 Connect link (`secrets/cloud-*`), which points at T3's relay and account.

## T3 Connect

- **Desktop:** Settings → Connections → T3 Connect.
- **Stale link:** if a machine says it is "already linked to a different cloud account", clear the
  old link with `t3 connect logout --base-dir ~/.otter-code`. On the desktop, run the CLI through
  the app binary with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` and `Contents/Resources/app.asar/apps/server/dist/bin.mjs`.
- **SSH-only hosts:** the desktop has no Connect switch for SSH environments, and Clerk's device
  grant is not enabled, so link from the host over an SSH session that forwards the loopback
  OAuth callback:

  ```sh
  ssh -tt -L 34338:127.0.0.1:34338 <host> \
    'T=$(ls -d ~/.otter-code/runtime/versions/*/t3 | sort -V | tail -1);
     env -u SSH_CONNECTION -u SSH_TTY -u SSH_CLIENT "$T" connect --base-dir ~/.otter-code'
  ```

  Open the printed `code.otterware.dev/connect` link on the local machine, approve it, then
  restart `otter-code.service` on the host so it brings the link up.

- **Relay reaching tunnels:** the relay Worker needs the `global_fetch_strictly_public`
  compatibility flag (`infra/relay/src/worker.ts`), because tunnels share the relay's zone.
  Without it, the relay's calls to a tunnel fail with Cloudflare 530 and phones report
  `endpoint_request_failed`.

## Other traps

- **Electron as Node:** agent shells inside Otter Code can inherit `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, and
  `open` passes it on, so an app launched from such a shell runs as plain Node and exits. Launch
  it with `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE open -a "Otter Code"`.
- **macOS runners:** macOS jobs run on `macos-15`. On GitHub's `macos-26` image, electron-builder
  below 26.16.1 fails to unlock its signing keychain. Move to `macos-26` in the generated script
  once upstream pins 26.16.1 or later.
